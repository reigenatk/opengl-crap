## Yet Another Github repo by reigenatk

I'm working through [this awesome resource](https://learnopengl.com/Introduction). Had enough of not understanding the first thing about graphics. Too impatient to wait for [a class at my school](https://illinois-cs418.github.io/) that teachers this subject matter (although all the notes are available online anyways lol). So I'm taking it into my own hands again :P

The motivation? Graphics is super important to understand, if I ever really wanna call myself a gamedev. Also I've always heard tons of buzzwords thrown around, things like "textures", "shaders", "DirectX", "Vulkan", "OpenGL", "anti-aliasing", "bloom", "ambient occlusion", "frag/vertex shaders"- and I want in on the know. **What does it all mean?** And finally, I recently went down the 3DCG rabithole, making a few things in Blender, and it just blew my mind how you can literally make anything in that program.

So yeah, as a cs student it makes me wonder- how did people program this? What do game engine programmers actually go through? I chose OpenGL because its the oldest of the graphics standards, and I figured the skills would transfer to newer standards. Hopefully by the end of this I'll have a nice video I can put together, showing some of the stuff that I ~~the author of the book but I really just copied and tweaked a bit~~ made.
