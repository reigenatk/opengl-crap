## Yet Another Github repo by reigenatk

I'm working through [this awesome resource](https://learnopengl.com/Introduction). Had enough of not understanding the first thing about graphics. Too impatient to wait for [a class at my school](https://illinois-cs418.github.io/) that teachers this subject matter (although all the notes are available online anyways lol). So I'm taking it into my own hands again :P

The motivation? Graphics is super important to understand, if I ever really wanna call myself a gamedev. Also I've always heard tons of buzzwords thrown around, things like "textures", "shaders", "DirectX", "Vulkan", "OpenGL", "anti-aliasing", "bloom", "ambient occlusion", "frag/vertex shaders"- and I want in on the know. **What does it all mean?** And finally, I recently went down the 3DCG rabithole, making a few things in Blender, and it just blew my mind how you can literally make anything in that program.

Another huge motivation was, I played this game called [Stray](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/), and it blew my mind. First of all it's probably my new favorite game ever, I highly recommend it. But anyways it was made in UE4, which is one of the most powerful 3D rendering tools right now. And so I got curious- **How is it possible to render such realistic scenes using code?** Because whatever it is, I wanna know. Graphics are getting freakishly good and I'm tired of being OOTL. And with UE5 coming up I'm sure it'll only get better and better.

I went with OpenGL because its the oldest of the graphics standards and seems the easiest to get into (it seems to be the Python of graphics, a good starting point?) and I figured the skills would transfer to newer standards. Hopefully by the end of this I'll have a nice video I can put together, showing some of the stuff that I ~~the author of the book but I really just copied and tweaked a bit~~ made.
